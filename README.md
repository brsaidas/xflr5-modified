### The Problem:
When I was a member of the Systems sub-team of the [Uir√° Aerodesign](https://www.instagram.com/uira_aerodesign/) team, we had a problem related to the collection of Ring Moment with the XFLR5 software for all models.

Until then, this problem demanded a lot of repetitive work from the sub-team members, as only one Ring Moment die for a given angle was removed at a time. And for our analysis we need an angle range.

To solve this problem I modified the software (open-source) so that these values are obtained more efficiently.
